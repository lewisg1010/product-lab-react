    Product Lab is Harvard‚Äôs first student-run product management organization. Through training programs, real-world product experience, and industry mentorship, we introduce product management to problem-solvers from all backgrounds and help them grow into future product leaders. This year, we are opening up our competitive case team application to all (even students who have not completed the educational comp process in the Fall)! In the past, we‚Äôve worked with companies such as Salesforce, Duolingo, Hubspot, and more!
